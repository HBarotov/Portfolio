#Welcome to my personal portfolio!

I am a junior web-designer that builds user-friendly and responsive layouts. I know and use CSS3 and Bootstrap5 in my projects. Now, I intend to enrich my experience and gain new knowledge.

A bit about me: I am a senior in high school, majoring in IT and economics. I am a good team player; I also have an outgoing character.

I enjoy reading books related to my fields and politics, as well as, the environment. My free time includes playing chess at chess.com and lichess.org too.
